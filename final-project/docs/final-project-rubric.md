Final Project

Note

The 2026 project requirements are currently a draft. You can use this page to see what we are preparing, but the final project rules, scoring, deadlines, and peer-review requirements may change before the cohort starts.
The final project applies the full course workflow to an end-to-end application of your own.

You will:

build and deploy a full-stack app with AI assistance
document how AI tools were used and reviewed
add an agent extension pack around the project
audit and harden the project with open-source AI security, audit, and DevOps tools
review peer projects
Expected Repository Contents

Your project repo should include:

README.md
product-spec.md
AGENTS.md or equivalent project instructions
frontend/
backend/
openapi.yaml
docker-compose.yml
.github/workflows/
docs/
security/
ops/
If you complete Module 5, it should also include an agent extension pack:

agent-capabilities/
agent-hooks/
mcp-server/
plugins/ or custom-agent/
docs/agent-extension-pack.md
docs/permissions.md
Peer Reviewing

Important

To evaluate projects, we use peer review. To get points for your project, you need to evaluate projects from your peers. Final peer-review requirements for the 2026 cohort are still being prepared.
